Installing the firmware:
------------------------

1) Set the fuse bits of the AtMega88 to:
   LFUSE = %%LFUSE%%
   HFUSE = %%HFUSE%%
   EFUSE = %%EFUSE%%
   Note that the original firmware uses different fuses. So this step must
   not be omitted.

2) Flash the binary firmware file xytronic-lf.hex to the program memory
   of the AtMega88.

3) Write the binary EEPROM image file xytronic-lf.eep.hex to the EEPROM
   memory of the AtMega88.
