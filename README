Installing the firmware:
------------------------

1) Set the fuse bits of the AtMega88 to:
   LFUSE = %%LFUSE%%
   HFUSE = %%HFUSE%%
   EFUSE = %%EFUSE%%
   Note that the original firmware uses different fuses. So this step must
   not be omitted.

   If you use avrdude, a command similar to the following can be used:

     avrdude -B 200 -p m88 -c avrisp2 -P usb -U lfuse:w:%%LFUSE%%:m -U hfuse:w:%%HFUSE%%:m -U efuse:w:%%EFUSE%%:m

2) Flash the firmware image file xytronic-lf.hex to the program memory
   of the AtMega88.

   If you use avrdude, a command similar to the following can be used:

     avrdude -B 1 -p m88 -c avrisp2 -P usb -U flash:w:xytronic-lf.hex

3) Write the EEPROM image file xytronic-lf.eep.hex to the EEPROM memory
   of the AtMega88.

   If you use avrdude, a command similar to the following can be used:

     avrdude -B 1 -p m88 -c avrisp2 -P usb -U eeprom:w:xytronic-lf.eep.hex
